This project is a set of tools for securing web applications. The project includes the following tools:
- Static analysis of code security (SAST) - tools to find vulnerabilities in the source code of an application.
- Dynamic Code Security Analysis (DAST) - tools to find vulnerabilities in a running web application.
- Machine learning - using machine learning algorithms to automatically search for vulnerabilities.

Problems of SAST analysis:
- Limited support for programming languages.
- Frequent false positives of analysis tools.
- Insufficient accuracy of vulnerability detection.

Solving SAST analysis problems:
- Using open platforms to analyze more programming languages.
- Correlation with other security analysis tools, such as DAST, to improve vulnerability detection accuracy.
- Using machine learning to automatically detect vulnerabilities.

Tools used
SAST: Bandit 1.7.4, ESLint.
DAST: ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy).
